Password Manager Using tkinter,
And it's going to be called MyPass, our password manager, and we're going to use it to store and generate passwords.

For example, if I wanted to create an account on App Brewery,
then I enter the name of the website so that I know what this password is for,

I put in my email, and username is already prepopulated in my password

manager. And then all I have to do is to either come up with a password

that is hopefully not terrible, but I can obviously never remember,

or I can use the builtin generate password to just generate me a very complex,

very long password with all of the required numbers and symbols and all of that.

And once I'm done with that, then I can click add,

and I get a popup asking me if this is okay.

And if that all looks good, then I click Yes

and that data gets added to a text file,

which I have on my computer.

So this is not an internet-based service and you keep everything locally on your

computer,

which some people feel is a lot safer than using a third-party service

like LastPass or whatever else.
